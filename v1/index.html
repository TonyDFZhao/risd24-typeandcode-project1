    <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a website?</h2>
    
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past handful of years, I've been teaching courses about interactive<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;design and the internet.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the internet's <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impact on art—and vice versa—and how technological advance often coincides with <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;artistic development.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup and code <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;languages of the web—HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails from <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;students asking, “So how do I actually make a website?”<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sparked my own questioning. “What is a website, anyway?” It's easy to forget. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today there are millions of ways to make a website, and the abundance is daunting. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at its core, a website is still the same as ever before:<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a computer that's always connected to the internet, so that when someone types <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually you have to pay for a <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server. You also have to pay for a domain name, which is an understandable piece <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of language that points to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your server.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Links (rendered default blue and underlined—they're the hypertext “HT” in HTML) <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are the oxygen of the web. Not all websites have links, but all links connect to <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other webpages, within the same site or elsewhere.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my students already know this! So when they ask me about actually making a <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;website, they are referring to a website in the world … today.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's healthy to acknowledge today's web is much different than the web many of us <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grew up using. So when they ask how to make a website (despite having already <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“learned”), they are alluding to the technological friction and social pressures <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.<br> 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universally popular social media sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above their users' <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs. Their users' happiness is not the primary focus, so it's perfectly normal <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you to feel anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ge of digital cacophony dominated by these platforms, no one is looking out for <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you… but you. It makes perfect sense, then, when individuals tell me they want <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their website to do the job of “setting the record straight” on who they are and <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what they do.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, clarity is one of many possible intentions for a website. There are other <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legitimate states of mind capable of communication—a surprising, memorable, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monumental, soothing, shocking, unpredictable, radically boring, bizarre, mind-<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blowing, very quiet and subtle, and/or amazing website could work. You also <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;need not limit yourself to only one website—as perhaps you'd like to confuse or <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surprise with multiple.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they're both subject and object<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be.<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there's potential for a self-<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;helps form your own identity.<br> 
        <br> 
        
        <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have a website?</h2>
        
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;web's future. The web is called the web because its vitality depends on just <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that—an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;handful of big corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply by having <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a website. I think artists, in particular, could be instrumental in this <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space—showing the world where the web can go.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when they share their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything—not only making things inside the world but also the surrounding world <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself—the language, style, rules, and architecture.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; works (the “objects”) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the architecture!). Ideally, the two would inform each other in a virtuous, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-perfecting loop. This can be incredibly nurturing to an artist's practice.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those creative people who say “I don't need a website,” I ask: why not have a <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;personal website that works strategically, in parallel to your other activities? <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How could a website complement what you already do rather than competing or <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here) for you? How can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to your approach?<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A website can be anything. It doesn't (and probably shouldn't) be an archive of <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your complete works. That's going to be dead the moment you publish. A website, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. It's imperfect—maybe sometimes <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it even has a few bugs. But that's the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spaces. What happens to websites after death, anyway?<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can a website be?</h2>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><a href="room.html">Website as room</a></em></h3>

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="shelf.html"><em>Website as shelf</em></a></h3>
 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="plant.html"><em>Website as plant</em></a></h3>
  
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><a href="garden.html">Website as garden</a></em></h3>
 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><a href="puddle.html">Website as puddle</a></em></h3>
        <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><a href="rock.html">Website as thrown rock that's now falling deep into the ocean</a></em></h3>

        <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The web is what we make it</h2>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While an individual website could be any of those metaphors I mentioned above, I believe <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the common prevailing metaphor—the internet as cloud—is problematic. The internet is <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one all-encompassing, mysterious, and untouchable thing. (In early patent drawings <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;depicting the internet, it appears as related shapes: a blob, brain, or explosion.) These <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;metaphors obfuscate the reality that the internet is made up of individual nodes: individual <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computers talking to other individual computers.<br>
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(image_6_sky_and_cloud)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Wide Web recently turned 29. On the web's birthday, Tim Berners Lee, its creator,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;published a letter stating the web's current state of threat. He says that while it's <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;called the “World Wide Web,” only about half the world is connected, so we should close <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this digital divide.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the same time, Berners Lee wants to make sure this thing we're all connecting to is <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truly working for us, as individuals: “I want to challenge us all to have greater ambitions <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the web. I want the web to reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our fears and deepen our divisions.”<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(image_7_birds_in_sky)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Metaphor unites reason and imagination,” says George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their book, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Metaphors We Live By (1980). “Metaphors are not merely things to be seen beyond. In fact, <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one can see beyond them only by using other metaphors. It is as though the ability to comprehend <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience through metaphor were a sense, like seeing or touching or hearing, with metaphors <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;providing the only ways to perceive and experience much of the world. Metaphor is as much a <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;part of our functioning as our sense of touch, and as precious.”<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of a cloud, let's use a metaphor that makes the web's individual, cooperative nodes <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more visible. This way, we can remember the responsibility we each have in building a better <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; web. The web is a flock of birds or a sea of punctuation marks, each tending or forgetting about <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their web garden or puddle home with a river of knowledge nearby.<br>
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a website has endless possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created and <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expanded by them, then it's instrumental that websites progress along with us. It's especially <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressing when forces continue to threaten the web and the internet at large. In an age of <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; information overload and an increasingly commercialized web, artists of all types are the <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people to help. Artists can think expansively about what a website can be. Each artist should <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create their own space on the web, for a website is an individual act of collective ambition.<br><br>

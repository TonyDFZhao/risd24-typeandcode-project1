    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Website as thrown rock that's now falling deep into the ocean</em></h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes you don't want a website that you'll have to maintain. You have other things <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to do. Why not consider your website a beautiful rock with a unique shape which you <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spent hours finding, only to throw it into the water until it hits the ocean floor? <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will never know when it hits the floor, and you won't care.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thankfully, rocks are plentiful and you can do this over and over again, if you like. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can throw as many websites as you want into the ocean. When an idea comes, find a <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rock and throw it.<br>

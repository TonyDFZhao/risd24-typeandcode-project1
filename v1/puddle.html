    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Website as puddle</em></h3>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A website could also be a puddle. A puddle is a temporary collection of rainwater. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They usually appear after rainstorms. Like a storm, creating a website can happen <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a burst. Sometimes it's nice to have a few bursts/storms of creating a website, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since the zone can be so elusive. Some people even call rain “computer weather.”<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also no state of “completeness” to a website, like a puddle, since they're <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ephemeral by nature. Sometimes they can be very big and reflective. Despite their <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temporal nature, I've even seen some creatures thrive in puddles. Meanwhile, some <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smaller puddles may only last a day.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everything, even the most beautiful puddle with its incredible reflective surface, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;needs to last long. If the world doesn't end tomorrow, there will be another storm. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where there's a hole, a puddle will appear again.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puddles evaporate slowly over time. It might be difficult, but I would love to see <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a website evaporate slowly, too.<br>

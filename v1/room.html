    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Website as room</em></h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it's finite, often <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a specific intended purpose.<br> 
        <br>

        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously, a room can be flexible: you can shift its contents or even include <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a temporary partition, depending on occasion. You can also position elements in <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spatial juxtaposition, or create entrances to adjacent rooms through links.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the early days of The Creative Independent, we sometimes thought of TCI's website <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a house next to a river. We considered the interviews the flowing water, as <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they were our house's nutrients and source of life. We would collect and drink from <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the water every day. But sometimes, depending on its nutrient makeup, the water would <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;change our house. We'd wake up to see a new door where a picture frame once was. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge became the architect.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like any metaphor, it's not perfect. For better or worse, it's much more difficult <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to delete a building than a website.<br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fred Rogers said you can grow ideas in the garden of your mind. Sometimes, once <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they're little seedlings and can stand on their own, it helps to plant them outside, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a garden, next to the others.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gardens have their own ways each season. In the winter, not much might happen, and <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that's perfectly fine. You might spend the less active months journaling in your <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;notebook: less output, more stirring around on input. You need both. Plants remind <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us that life is about balance.<br> 
        <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it's nice to quietly sit <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your ideas and place them onto separate pages.<br>

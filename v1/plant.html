    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Website as plant</em></h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plants can't be rushed. They grow on their own. Your website can be the same way, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as long as you pick the right soil, water it (but not too much), and provide adequate <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sunlight. Plant an idea seed one day and let it gradually grow.<br> 
        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it will flower after a couple of years. Maybe the next year it'll bear fruit, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you're lucky. Fruit could be friends or admiration or moneyâ€”success comes in many <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forms. But don't get too excited or set goals: that's not the idea here. Like I said, <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;plants can't be rushed.<br>
